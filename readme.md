# Automated System for Indoor Strawberry Cultivation

This project presents a design and analysis for an automated indoor strawberry cultivation system. Utilizing modern technologies such as MQTT, the system allows for precise control and monitoring of various environmental factors that influence strawberry growth, including lighting, irrigation, and computing resources.

## Features

- **Digital Twin Predictions**: Predicts energy consumption, yield, and other factors based on given parameters.
- **Real-time Control**: Parameters such as light hours, irrigation, and more can be controlled in real time via MQTT.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Monitors and predicts energy consumption to optimize costs.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily customizable to suit different growth conditions and requirements.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Paho MQTT Client

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Configure the MQTT broker and topics as per your setup.

### Running the Application

Execute the main script, and the application will start listening to the configured MQTT topics for parameter updates.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language used for development.
- **MQTT**: Used for real-time control and monitoring of the system.
